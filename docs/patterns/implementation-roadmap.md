# DDD Implementation Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have ✅

1. **Clean Architecture Structure**
   - Clear separation of layers (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation)
   - Dependency inversion with repository interfaces
   - Use case pattern for business workflows

2. **Basic Domain Model**
   - Customer and Order entities
   - Repository abstractions
   - Immutable entities using dataclasses

3. **Working Infrastructure**
   - FastAPI for REST API
   - SQLAlchemy models for persistence
   - In-memory repositories for testing

### What We're Missing ❌

1. **Rich Domain Model**
   - Value Objects (using primitives instead)
   - Aggregate design (implicit, not explicit)
   - Domain Services
   - Domain Events

2. **Shared Kernel**
   - Common base classes
   - Shared value objects
   - Type definitions
   - Domain exceptions

3. **Advanced Patterns**
   - Specification pattern for queries
   - Unit of Work pattern
   - Domain event handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Shared Kernel Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal**: Establish shared kernel with base classes and common value objects

**Tasks**:
1. Create shared kernel directory structure
2. Implement base classes:
   - `Entity` base class
   - `ValueObject` base class
   - `AggregateRoot` base class
   - `DomainEvent` base class
   - `Specification` base class

3. Implement common value objects:
   - `Email` value object
   - `Money` value object
   - `Address` value object
   - `PhoneNumber` value object

4. Add type definitions:
   - `CustomerId`, `OrderId` as typed UUIDs
   - Common type aliases

5. Update existing entities to use shared kernel

**Deliverables**:
- `/src/shared_kernel/` fully implemented
- All tests passing with new base classes
- Documentation updated

### Phase 2: Enrich Domain Model (Week 2)

**Goal**: Transform anemic domain model to rich domain model

**Tasks**:
1. Replace primitive types with value objects:
   - Customer.email → Email value object
   - Order.total_amount → Money value object
   - Add Address value object to Customer

2. Implement proper aggregates:
   - Make Order a proper aggregate with OrderLineItems
   - Add business methods to aggregates
   - Enforce invariants within aggregates

3. Add domain services:
   - `PricingService` for complex calculations
   - `CustomerTierService` for tier management

4. Implement domain events:
   - `CustomerCreated`, `CustomerEmailChanged`
   - `OrderPlaced`, `OrderShipped`
   - Event collection in aggregates

**Deliverables**:
- Rich domain model with behavior
- Domain services implemented
- Event system working

### Phase 3: Advanced Repository Patterns (Week 3)

**Goal**: Implement specification pattern and improve repositories

**Tasks**:
1. Implement specification pattern:
   - Base `Specification` class
   - Common specifications (Active, InDateRange, etc.)
   - Repository methods accepting specifications

2. Add Unit of Work pattern:
   - Transaction management
   - Change tracking
   - Batch operations

3. Improve repository implementations:
   - Efficient query building from specifications
   - Batch operations support
   - Caching strategy

**Deliverables**:
- Specification pattern working
- Unit of Work implemented
- Performance improvements

### Phase 4: E-Commerce Platform Domain (Week 4)

**Goal**: Apply DDD patterns to e-commerce platform specific needs

**Tasks**:
1. Define catalog domain value objects:
   - `DataType` with validation rules
   - `Price` for product pricing with discounts
   - `BusinessRule` for business rules
   - `FieldConstraints` for data constraints

2. Create catalog aggregates:
   - `DatasetDefinition` aggregate
   - `ProcessingPipeline` aggregate
   - `BusinessRuleset` aggregate

3. Implement catalog domain services:
   - `SchemaEvolutionService`
   - `DataBusinessRuleService`
   - `TransformationService`

4. Define catalog domain events:
   - `DatasetVersionCreated`
   - `BusinessRuleFailed`
   - `PipelineExecutionCompleted`

**Deliverables**:
- Complete catalog domain model
- Services for catalog operations
- Event-driven architecture ready

## Code Examples

### Before (Current State)

```python
# Current - Anemic domain model
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Customer:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    email: str  # Primitive type
    is_active: bool
    preferences: dict[str, Any]
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    
    # Only data, no behavior
```

### After (Target State)

```python
# Target - Rich domain model
@dataclass
class Customer(AggregateRoot):
    # Typed identifiers
    id: CustomerId
    
    # Value objects instead of primitives
    email: Email
    phone: Optional[PhoneNumber]
    
    # Rich nested objects
    addresses: List[Address]
    preferences: CustomerPreferences
    
    # State with meaning
    tier: CustomerTier
    status: CustomerStatus
    
    # Business behavior
    def change_email(self, new_email: Email, reason: str) -> None:
        """Business logic with validation"""
        if self.status == CustomerStatus.SUSPENDED:
            raise BusinessRuleViolationException(
                "Cannot change email for suspended customer"
            )
        
        old_email = self.email
        self.email = new_email
        
        # Raise domain event
        self.add_event(
            CustomerEmailChanged(
                customer_id=self.id,
                old_email=old_email,
                new_email=new_email,
                reason=reason
            )
        )
    
    def upgrade_tier(self) -> None:
        """Complex business logic"""
        # Implementation with rules
        pass
```

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Over-Engineering
**Mitigation**: Start simple, add complexity only where it provides value

### Risk 2: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**: Profile critical paths, optimize where necessary

### Risk 3: Team Learning Curve
**Mitigation**: Pair programming, documentation, code reviews

### Risk 4: Breaking Changes
**Mitigation**: Incremental refactoring, comprehensive tests

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve Plan**: Get team alignment on approach
2. **Set Up Shared Kernel**: Create structure and base classes
3. **Pick First Aggregate**: Start with Customer or Order
4. **Iterate and Learn**: Adjust plan based on learnings
